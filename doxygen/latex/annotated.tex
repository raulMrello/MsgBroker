\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_list}{List$<$ T $>$} \\*\hyperlink{class_list}{List} management class accepts items of type T }{\pageref{class_list}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_msg_broker}{Msg\-Broker} \\*This class provides publish/subscription infrastructure as interprocess communication mechanism. Topics are the exchanged data structures which by one side will be ready to be subscribed to, or updated by publish functions. It is a thread safe implementation, so it can be used in baremetal or R\-T\-O\-S-\/based applications. If a mutex is required on R\-T\-O\-S-\/based applications, def macro M\-U\-T\-E\-X\-\_\-\-L\-O\-C\-K and M\-U\-T\-E\-X\-\_\-\-U\-N\-L\-O\-C\-K can be adapted according with your needs }{\pageref{class_msg_broker}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_msg_broker_1_1_observer}{Msg\-Broker\-::\-Observer} \\*\hyperlink{struct_msg_broker_1_1_observer}{Observer} structure is formed by a handler and a notification callback. Subscriber objects attached to topic updates, will be registered in the \hyperlink{class_msg_broker}{Msg\-Broker} as \hyperlink{struct_msg_broker_1_1_observer}{Observer} structures }{\pageref{struct_msg_broker_1_1_observer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_msg_broker_1_1_topic}{Msg\-Broker\-::\-Topic} \\*Is the topic structure, formed by a list of observers, a topic name, pointer to the latest data update, data size and count of notification consumption }{\pageref{struct_msg_broker_1_1_topic}}{}
\end{DoxyCompactList}
